# AI-Powered-Terrain-Assessment-for-Autonomous-Landing


Develop an intelligent landing system for Martian missions utilizing deep learning-based terrain classification. Train a powerful AI model to analyse incoming landing images, automatically identify safe and scientifically valuable landing zones, classify other regions of the image and guide the spacecraft to a precise touchdown, eliminating human intervention and enhancing mission autonomy.
